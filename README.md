# WindFetch
The Wind Fetch toolkits are used for calculating and analyzing a reservoir's exposure to wind-induced waves using fetch lines. The fetch line is the distance in meters between any point in the reservoir and the shoreline, measured in the direction from which the wind blows. The tools utilize a layer of points and the reservoir's outline as a polygon to calculate effective fetch in points. The tools also use wind direction frequency and speed to analyze wind fetch and the Relative Exposure Index.

The Wind Fetch tools include the following files:

    • Fetch Python OGR.ipynb: Jupyter notebook with all functions for creating and analyzing wind fetch.
    • fetch2.zip: Wind fetch plugin for QGIS.
    • wfetch.pyt: Wind fetch toolbox for ArcGIS Pro.
    • WindFetch_manual_QGIS.pdf: Manual for the wind fetch plugin for QGIS.
    • WindFetch_manual_ArcGISPro.pdf: Manual for the wind fetch toolbox for ArcGIS Pro.
    • test_fetch.zip: Sample test data for working with the tools.
